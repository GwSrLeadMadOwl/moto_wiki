        <p>BMW Motorrad already introduced the successful M vehicle offer strategy at
            the end of 2018 for motorcycles and has been offering M optional equipment and M
            performance parts ever since. With the new BMW M 1000 RR – in the following
            referred to as M RR in short – the first M model from BMW Motorrad based on the
            S 1000 RR (RR for short) is now celebrating its world premiere. BMW Motorrad
            follows the philosophy of the strongest letter in the world: M stands worldwide
            for success in motor racing and the fascination of high-performance BMW models
            and is aimed at customers with particularly high demands relating to
            performance, exclusiveness and individuality.</p>

        <p>With an engine output of 156 kW (212 HP), a DIN vehicle kerb weight of only
            192 kg and a suspension and aerodynamics designed for maximum race track
            performance, the new M RR meets the main expectations in the top segment of
            Superbikes.</p>

        <h3>M RR four-cylinder engine based on the RR engine for racing sport. More
            peak power and increased maximum engine speed.</h3>

        <p>The new M RR uses a water-cooled four-cylinder in-line engine based on the RR
            power train with BMW ShiftCam technology for varying valve timing and valve lift
            that has been modified comprehensively in the direction of a racing sport
            engine. It achieves its peak output of 156 kW (212 HP) at 14,500 rpm. The
            maximum torque of 113 Nm is applied at 11,000 rpm. In addition to a maximum
            speed increased to 15,100 rpm, the M RR engine has extensive technical
            optimisations such as new 2-ring forged pistons from Mahle, adapted combustion
            chambers, compression increased to 13.5, longer and lighter titanium connecting
            rods from Pankl, slimmer and lighter rocker arms, fully machined intake ports
            with new duct geometry as well as optimisations on camshafts and intake area.
            The lightweight exhaust system is also made of titanium. The new M RR engine is
            even more powerful than the RR power train in the range from 6,000 rpm to 15,100
            rpm, a range that is particularly relevant for race track driving dynamics, but
            without losing its qualities as a fascinating source of power for sporty driving
            on country roads.</p>

        <h3>M winglets and high windscreen: Braking later and accelerating earlier
            thanks to the aerodynamic downforce without any reduction in maximum speed.</h3>

        <p>The aerodynamics were a decisive point in the technical specifications for
            development work of the M RR. In addition to a maximum speed that is as high as
            possible and absolutely necessary for winning races, there was another objective
            in the technical specifications of the M RR: to establish the best possible
            contact of the wheels with the road – especially when accelerating. The M
            winglets on the trim front, which were developed during intensive testing on the
            race track and in the BMW Group’s wind tunnel and are made of clear-coat carbon,
            take this into account as they produce aerodynamic downforce and thus additional
            wheel loads according to the speed. The additional wheel load on the front wheel
            counteracts wheelie inclination, traction control regulates less, more driving
            power is converted into acceleration and the driver achieves faster lap times.
            The effect of the winglets is also noticeable in curves and when braking, the
            downforce allows later braking and ensures increased cornering stability.</p>

        <h3>Born for racing: M design and dynamic form language of the M RR indicate
            ultimate race track performance.</h3>

        <p>
            The new M RR emphasises its racing genes with the light white solid paint/M
            Sport colour scheme in the basic colours light blue, dark blue and red. Further
            features of the M RR are the engine covers in granite grey and the fuel filler
            cap painted black.<br>

        <h3>Uncompromising in design and technology: The M RR with M competition
            package.</h3>
        <p>
            For those who are still not satisfied with the new M RR in standard trim, the
            M competition package provides a fascinating mixture of classy components for
            the racing technology gourmet and the aesthete at the same time. In addition to
            the M GPS laptrigger software and the corresponding activation code, the M
            competition package also includes the M milled parts package, the M carbon
            package as well as a silver 220 g lighter swinging arm, the friction-optimised,
            maintenance-free and DLC-coated M Endurance chain and the passenger package
            including tail-hump cover.<br>
